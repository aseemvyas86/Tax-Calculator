## Overview

The Tax Calculator is a web application that calculates the total marginal income tax based on the userâ€™s annual income and selected tax year. It uses a mock API to retrieve tax brackets, applies progressive tax rates, and displays the result formatted with thousand separators. The project is built with React, TypeScript, and Material-UI, and features a scalable architecture with clear separation between business logic, API services, and UI components.
