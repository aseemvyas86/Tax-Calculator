## Overview

The Tax Calculator is a web application that calculates the total marginal income tax based on the userâ€™s annual income and selected tax year. It uses a mock API to retrieve tax brackets, applies progressive tax rates, and displays the result formatted with thousand separators. The project is built with React, TypeScript, and Material-UI, and features a scalable architecture with clear separation between business logic, API services, and UI components.

### How to Change the Available Tax Years
The Tax Calculator dynamically generates the list of valid tax years from constants. To change the available tax years:

 src folder --> constants.ts

```
export const TAX_YEAR_START = 2019;
export const TAX_YEAR_END = 2025; // Change this to update the range.
